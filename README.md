## Configuration Setup:

Sensitive File Requirements:

This project requires certain .json files for configuration purposes. However, to maintain security, these files are not included in the repository. You will need to obtain these files separately and place them in the following locations:

app/google-services.json: [file can be found from google firebase. After registering this app in your Firebase poject,firebase will generate a google-services.json file specifically configured for this app.],

"app/src/main/assets/api.properties" file if there are still some challenges[create an API key (https://newsapi.org/) and place it here (app/src/main/assets/api.properties)for the variable API_KEY] .

ALternatively use android studio to bypass login activities in which case you wont have your app data.
